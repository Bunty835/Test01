// Ex:- let arr = [12,18,45,23,98,76,56,90,84,68] 
// const newArray = arr.filter(num => num > 50);
// console.log(newArray);


  // Question 4.  print a new array all numbers are greater then 50
//   let arr = [12,18,45,23,98,76,56,90,84,68] 
// const newArray = arr.filter(num => num > 50);
